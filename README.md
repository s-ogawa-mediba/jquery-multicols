#jquery.multicols.js

## Change from single column to Multi Columns automaticaly

If you will layout some checkboxes or radiobuttons,
You can write those tags single group.

DON'T customize dl, ul and ol tag by server side script!!
I hope that your tags will be customized by DOM before rendering html.
